We have developed the grouped bar graph to analyze the months with the highest and lowest reservation levels according to the reservation status. As can be seen, both the number of confirmed reservations and the number of canceled  reservations are one of the largest in August whereas January is the month with the most canceled reservations.

This bar graph demonstrates that cancellations are most common when prices are greatest and are least common when they are lowest. Therefore, the cost of the accommodation is solely responsible for the cancellation

Now, let's see which country has the highest reservation canceled. The top country is Portugal with the highest number of cancellations.

Let's check the area from where guests are visiting the hotels and making reservations.
Is it coming from Direct or Groups, online or Offline Travel Agents? Around 46% of the clients come from online travel agencies, whereas 27% come from groups. Only 4% of clients book hotels directly by visiting them and making reservations.

As seen in the graph, reservations are canceled when the average daily rate is higher than when it is not canceled. It proves all the above analysis, that the higher price led to higher cancellations.



# Suggestions

### 1. Cancellation rates rise as the price does. To prevent cancellations of reservations, hotels could work on their pricing strategies and try to lower the rates for specific hotels based on locations. They can also provide some discounts to the customers.

### 2. The ratio of cancellations and not cancellations of the resort hotel is higher in the resort hotel than in the city hotels. So the hotels should provide reasonable discounts on the room prices on weekends and holidays.

### 3. In January, hotels can start campaigns or marketing with a reasonable to increase their revenue as the cancellations is the highest in this month.

### 4. They can also increase the quality of their hotels and their services mainly in Portugal to reduce the cancellation rate
